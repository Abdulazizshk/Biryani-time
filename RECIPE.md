Recipe of Biryani
Step 1: Marinate the chicken with yogurt and place it in a large pot and layer it with fried onions and put some corriander in it.
Step 2 : boil rice in light water make sure to put enough spice in it until it tastes the way you want it.
Step3: to add even more taste to it put bright yellow rice and ghee(melted butter).
Step4: then cover the pot on gas for about 25 min and let the rice absorb the water and the flavours of the spices.
Final step: then remove the freshly cooked Biryani from the pot and then you can enjoy it with your family or freinds.
